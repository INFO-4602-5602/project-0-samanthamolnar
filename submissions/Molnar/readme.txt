This is project 0 visualization for InfoVis by Samantha Molnar.
Collaborators: Allie Morgan, discussions with Melissa Bica and Jennings ...

The following bells & whistles are implemented:
	1) Tooltip. Hover over datapoints in Part3&4 to see the point values.
	2) Line of best fit for each data set in part 5.
	3) Menu transition for scatter plot in part 3&4.
	4) View x and y values as bar charts, attempted coordinated views.
	5) Internet ussage:
		-I used https://color.adobe.com/ to look for color schemes.  It's pretty neat if you haven't checked it out!
		- I used http://bl.oscks.org/Caged/6476579 to see an example of how to create a better tooltip.
